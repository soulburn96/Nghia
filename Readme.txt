Dear sir/madam

Here is my Git and included all of the project that I have participated. My role in every project is game programmer and some project I also did game design. For all of my project I will seperate it into 3 categories. 

The first one is beginner when I just started to study game development. The members of my group is also beginner so the game itself is a bit buggy and also the code is bad. The DoggyBuild, RPGBuild and MultiplayerGameBuild is in this group.

The second one is intermediate is when I study more about VR and I attended to a VR school project about Fire Training Project and an internship in PunnuGames.For the VR project, I have made scripting for main game core mechanics and Mikko 
did the ScriptableObject and UI scripts. Unfortunately, my tasks at PunnuGame is to maintain the project, fixing bugs and I don't even know which code is mine anymore so I will not attach it here. I attached the build here if you want to take a look at it. 

The last one is advance which is my most recently projects. The Fireman is the minigames that I made independently from the main game Virpa2. The idea of the game is a Pacman clone with some adjustments. The player have to rescure friends 
and get away from the Fire to the emergency exit. The game will teach kids fire safety from playing it. Also by doing this game I learnt myself skills and tried some important principles. I tried some game programming partern and architecture
I just learnt from the Game Programming Parterns books like Events, Bytecode, State Machine,... Also doing level design myself and A* AI pathfinding is quite helpful for me in the future. Other than that I doing my Thesis and it's about 
EyesTracking Data Visualliaztion. I used 3 methods for this Visuallization. Graphs for raw data,Heatmap and Scanpath for gaze parterns. Also I can't attached the whole project here since it's belong to the GameLab so I can only attached my coding
works. Here is the version that working with the normal Unity Camera so I think it might be better for you to understand. The Varjo Camera with eyestracking go with the Varjo library so it might be a bit confuse. 

Base on the level of diffuculty, I recommended you to take a look at the advance level (FireMan and Thesis). I think it can demonstrates the highlight of my skillset. 

Thanks for reading this!!!
